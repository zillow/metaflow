### What to expect
Once you launch a notebook environment in Binder, you wil see the following:

* [`0-jupyter.ipynb`](0-jupyter.ipynb): Basics of Jupyter Notebook. Start here if you are not familiar with Jupyter notebook.
* [`1-basics.ipynb`](1-basics.ipynb): Composing and running a sample flow.
* [`2-titanic.ipynb`](2-titanic.ipynb): Running feature engineering, training and scoring on classic titanic dataset using Metaflow.
* [`ui.ipynb`](ui.ipynb): A showcase of how UI for metaflow looks like. Inspect metadata, logs and more about your flows here.
